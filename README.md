Earthquake prediction using Machine Learning and Trend Analysis

## Problem Statement :-
Predicting the earthquake and the scale/impact of it in the regions prone to it. 

## Addressing the problem:- 
It is well known that if a disaster has happened in a region, it is likely to happen there again. Some regions really have frequent earthquakes, but this is just a comparative quantity compared to other regions. 

To obtain the best fit so that we can predict accurately we need large number of training examples. 

## Approach:- 
Data set type 1: **Direct Inference**

● Information of the past earthquakes of that region.  (Detecting certain pattern/trends from previous earthquakes.)

Data set type 2: **Indirect Inference**

● The disasters like tsunami, landslide, floods caused due to breakage of dams/reservoirs are because of the internally caused earthquakes or more precisely due to the tectonic movement of plates in that region.

● Analyzing and Focusing on periodic tectonic shifts across the area of interest.
